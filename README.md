# Linked Data Helper

This plugin is needed for generating the data that the [Linked Data Vocabularies](https://github.com/kometenstaub/obsidian-linked-data-vocabularies) Obsidian plugin relies on.

The settings have a step by step guide for each implemented dataset. (Currently, LCSH is supported, but there are plans to extend support to other linked data.)

By default, if possible, the generated files will be stored in the attachments folder, in the `linked-data-vocabularies` subfolder. If this is not possible, the settings will tell you.

In that case, you will have to input another path. You can also input an alternative output path, if you so wish.

After the conversion is done, this plugin can be disabled until you want to update the data or add another dataset.
